# Markdown Preview Test

This is a **test markdown file** to verify the _markdown rendering_ feature.

## Features Tested

Here are some things we want to test:

### Headings
Different heading levels should have different colors and styles.

### Lists

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Nested item 2.1
  - Nested item 2.2
- Item 3

### Code

Inline code like `let x = 42;` should be styled differently.

Code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
    let result = add(2, 3);
}

fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}
```

### Emphasis

- **Bold text**
- *Italic text*
- ***Bold and italic***
- ~~Strikethrough~~

### Blockquote

> This is a blockquote.
> It should have a special prefix.

### Horizontal Rule

---

That's the end of the test file!
